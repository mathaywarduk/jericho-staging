Recently, Rich sat down with Julia Head of Nottingham's iconic [*LeftLion*](https://leftlion.co.uk/) magazine to share the story behind Restaurant Jericho.

When we started Jericho, the goal was to create an experience where people could connect to the land and the food we grow. Having been part of the farming community for generations, Grace and Rich knew that if they wanted to build something meaningful, it needed to reflect the values that have shaped our lives. That's why they’ve put such a strong focus on sustainability, locally sourced ingredients, and open-fire cooking. Every dish we serve tells the story of the land, the seasons, and the people who grow it.

The interview with *LeftLion* gave us the opportunity to reflect on how far we’ve come and what sets us apart in such a competitive industry. For us, it’s not just about high-end dining; it’s about fostering a kitchen culture that’s rooted in collaboration, creativity, and mutual respect. I shared with Julia how we’ve built an environment that encourages our team to grow together and celebrate the joy of cooking, rather than focusing on stress or competition. That ethos has resonated not just with our team, but with our guests as well, who often mention how welcoming and calm the atmosphere feels when they visit.
